Coming from someone who wanted to be a mathematician, I realized that my real passion was AI. The field I want to pursue is NLP, but pursuing AI engineering or AI research is still an open question for me. Currently, I want to become an AI researcher but who knows in a few years I can become Fullstack.. **Winter is coming but Q1 may not come with winter**..

This seminar is especially for PTIT students and is completely free, allowing students to access knowledge without having to worry about costs.
                - The seminar focuses deeply on theory and mathematics, helping students better understand the important theoretical foundations behind algorithms and applications in artificial intelligence. This is a great opportunity for students to explore the connection between mathematics and AI, without having to focus too much on programming or coding. In addition, participating students will receive a certificate after completing the program, recognizing their efforts and achievements during their participation. This is a high-quality learning environment where students can improve the knowledge and skills necessary for fields related to artificial intelligence.
